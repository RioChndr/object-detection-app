# Note 
Why i Choose YOLO as pre-trained model for this project ?, because that's the most accurate pre-trained model than other pre-trained. even though my laptop need 2 second to detect object on image, but maybe other machine could run this faster than that (based claim from developer YOLO that this framework could run 1000% faster on GPU)
